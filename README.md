Server Automation Scripting

Allows tweets to perform a limited subset of commands on a server machine allowing easy, remote, public control

While this is not designed to prevent malicious excution of commands, the limited dictionary of commands prevents excution of persistant malicious commands. 

The script will search twitter for tweets with a specific hashtag and will execute the commands in its dictionary found in the tweet

Runs on Python 3 and uses the Twython library
